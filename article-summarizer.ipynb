      "Subsequently, an integrated intelligent device serves as the foundation for establishing a model that applies intelligent classification and algorithms based on the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO)\n",
      "Concurrently, the spatial complexities of the SVM-based and SOLO-based intelligent literacy improvement models are determined to be 45 and 22, respectively\n",
      "Notably, it is discerned that, with escalating iterations, the SOLO algorithm exhibits higher accuracy and reduced spatial complexity in evaluating teachers’ pedagogical literacy\n",
      "Consequently, the utilization of AI methodologies proves highly efficacious in advancing electronic imaging technology and enhancing the efficacy of image recognition in educational instruction\n",
      "Amidst the rapid expansion of societal information, electronic educational resources have emerged as an integral cornerstone of contemporary educational paradigms\n",
      "Cognitive literacy, encompassing a teacher’s proficiency in leveraging advanced technologies to enhance instructional capabilities and adapt to diverse learning needs, emerges as a comprehensive competency\n",
      "This proficiency spans various aspects of intelligent technology applications, including but not limited to data analysis, personalized instructional design, and real-time feedback.\n"

While the token-based score of 0.331 suggests a marginally lesser sentiment compared to the lemma-based score of 0.456, the latter may offer a more nuanced perspective owing to lemmatization. When juxtaposed with the initial article's polarity score of 0.15894, these scores underscore variations in sentiment analysis methodologies and underscore the significance of considering diverse linguistic features in sentiment assessment. Together, these scores facilitate a deeper comprehension of the emotional tone conveyed by the summarized content relative to the original article."
